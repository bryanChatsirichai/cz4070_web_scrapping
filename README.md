## take note
- Excel file will be created when done. (git hub version may not be up to date the suppose correct version I push to telegram already).
- certain post information row not collected due to some bug I no time fix so lesser victims added to excel but should be enough.
- Certain configuration may fail due to vm, port, tor connection so configure to fix.
- Certain scrapping hardcoded, as website not well structure, different element  but same layout etc...
